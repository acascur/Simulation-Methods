# Simulation-Methods
In this repository you can find Python code of classical simulation problems:  Monte-Carlo methods, Metropolis–Hastings algorithm, pseudo-random numbers generators, random walk, percolation, probability calculations and generation of probability distribution. In the ***simulation methods overview*** Notebook you can see some examples about this topic. I plan to upload more detailed code in the future.
