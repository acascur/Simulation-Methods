# Simulation-Methods
In this repository you can find python code of classical simulation problems:  Monte-Carlo methods, Metropolisâ€“Hastings algorithm, random and pseudo-random numbers, random walk, percolation, probability calculations and generation of probability distribution. In the ***simulation methods overview*** Notebook you can see some examples about this topic. I plan to upload more detailed code in the future.
